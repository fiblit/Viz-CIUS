# To Run

(this probably looks awful on github)

Either set the --allow-file-access-from-files in your chrome exe
  (PLEASE remember to turn it off before you go browsing the web again)

OR (my favorite since it is safe, and you get to have python :) )
  1. Install python (3, preferrably) if you don't already have it 
    https://www.python.org/
  2. If you're using python 2 type:
    python -m SimpleHttpServer
  3. If you're using python 3 type:
    python -m http.server
    or 
    python3 -m http.server
    depending on how you set up the paths.
  4. Goto this URL;
     http://localhost:8000/HW4_Starter.html

OR
    Open HW4_Starter.html in Mozilla Firefox:
    https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/products/
