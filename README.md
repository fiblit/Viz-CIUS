# To Run

(this probably looks awful on github)

Either set the --allow-file-access-from-files in your chrome exe
  (PLEASE remember to turn it off before you go browsing the web again)

OR
    Open HW4_Starter.html in Mozilla Firefox, which defaults to the unsafe chrome setting. You can get Firefox here: `https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/products/`

OR (my favorite since it is safe, and you get to have python :) )
  1. Install python (3, preferrably). If you don't already have it you can get it here: `https://www.python.org/`
  2. If you're using python 2 type this in the repo directory: `python -m SimpleHttpServer`
  3. If you're using python 3 type in the repo directory: `python -m http.server` or  `python3 -m http.server`
    depending on how you set up the PATH environment variable.
  4. Goto this URL: `http://localhost:8000/HW4_Starter.html`
